# data-structure-huffman-tree
A project indicates us to implement the huffman tree when we are freshman.
In my perspective,this project is too difficult for those who didnt learn about the data structure.
Besides,our professor didnt introduce some basic techniques before we start the project.
This project has a introduction file,but I forget where it goes. ==
